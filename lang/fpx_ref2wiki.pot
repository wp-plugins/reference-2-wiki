"The call of the search term for Wikipedia to be carried out as described in "
"MediaWiki in double brackets [[keyword]]. Optionally, the text can be "
"specified to display [[search | display text]] or a deviation of the default "
"language in the form of [[language | search | display text]] will be carried "
"out. If the second parameter (Wikipedia keyword) is empty, is used to "
"display text, thus [[language | | display text]] is identical to [[language "
"| display text | display text]]. The language is in the two typical "
"abbreviations such as en, de, fr, etc. specified"
